# Rachel Ord Portfolio

## Description 

I wwanted to put together a starting portfolio to highlight my skills, experience, and utilise some coding in the process! 

This portfolio site contains an About Me section, highlights future projects, as well as lists my contact information.

This portfolio site is a work in progress, and I will add to it when I continue to gain experience!
